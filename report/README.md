This report describe the fisheries statistics of five major groups in RUMAKI seascape. The collection and analysis of fishery data and information is a costly and timely exercise. To be relevant and cost-effective, fishery data and information collection systems must have a clear set of objectives and appropriate strategies to collect data, which should be based on priorities and requirements of data users. However, chronic problems of insufficient human and financial resources allocated for data collection often resulted in the poor quality of information that further led to no- or limited use of statistics for fishery management and policy development. Consequently only dwindling support was given to the systematic improvement of national fishery data and information collection systems.   There is an urgent need to terminate this vicious cycle of problems. The previous budget allocated by the Government for data collection during CAS should be more than enough if re-allocated to the used in the improved eCAS data collection system
