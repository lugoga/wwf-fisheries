# Recommendation and Conclusion {-}

## Recommendation on the quality of fisheries data. {-}
For the purpose of improving fisheries data collection system, the following are sets of recommendations that this report suggests, which may improve the process and facilitate the management of the artisanal fisheries \index{Fisheries!artisanal}: 

+ The Department of Fisheries (DoF)\index{Institutions!Department of Fisheries} in collaboration with TAFIRI\index{Institutions!TAFIRI} should consider identifying representative species for all priority (major) fisheries groups and consistency follow up the data collection on the identified species.
+ The DoF should consider adapting and upscaling the e--CAS\index{Tools!e--CAS} as the main data collection tool. Promote timely preparation of fishery statistics\index{Fisheries!statistics} through the application of the databases\index{database}. This should go along with the timely sharing of the statistics with relevant stakeholders\index{stakeholder}.  
+ Promote capacity development to all levels in the area of data collection, processing, analysis, interpretation and reporting.
+ Periodic strategic planning/system review of marine fisheries, data collection should be in a position to answer some of the management questions at any time.
+ Promotion and adoption of statistical systems for small-scale coastal fisheries. 
+ The DoF in collaboration with other stakeholders should explore ways to develop and implement multi-sectoral indicators analysis as an approach to monitor the stock, such indicators could include socioeconomics and livelihood data, this can be incorporated in the current data collection and analysis. 
+ There is a need for improvement on data collection related to data fish species diversity, effort, trade and market value of individual species. This can be integrated into the current system or collected separately.

## Conclusion {-}
The collection and analysis of fishery data and information is a costly and timely exercise. To be relevant and cost-effective \index{Management!cost-effective}, fishery data and information collection systems must have a clear set of objectives and appropriate strategies to collect data, which should be based on priorities and requirements of data users. However, chronic problems of insufficient human and financial resources allocated for data collection often resulted in the poor quality of information that further led to non- or limited use of statistics for fishery management and policy development. Consequently only dwindling support was given to the systematic improvement of national fishery data and information collection systems.   There is an urgent need to terminate this vicious cycle of problems. The previous budget allocated by the Government for data collection during CAS should be more than enough if re-allocated to the used in the improved eCAS data collection system.
